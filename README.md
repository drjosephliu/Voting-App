Back-end project from FreeCodeCamp built using React, Node/Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, HighCharts.


#### User stories:

1. As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

2. As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

3. As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

4. As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

5. As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

6. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

7. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
